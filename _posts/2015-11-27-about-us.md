David Alan Harvey once wrote - **_Don't shoot what it looks like shoot what it feels like_**.

I am really in such a wonderful position. I get to document the most important day on any families calendar. I get to be part of your celebrations, your tears and your laughter.  I absolutely adore what I do and I hope it comes through in the images I produce.

**Meet Lisa**

Lisa likes all kinds of music, hot coffee and anything with a polka dot!

She loves a laugh, a good comedy and a great documentary.

She loves to get to know her clients before the wedding so when the day comes round its like having an old friend there

**Meet Rob**

Rob brings 30+ years of graphic design experience to the business.

He is the photo editor and album designer. Working hard to make your images look their very best in print and online.

Rob enjoys riding his motorbike when he gets a chance. He is also a part time fire fighter and devoted dad.
